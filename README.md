In July 2023 I started powerlifting, at my fabulous local gym, [The Project PT](https://www.theprojectpt.com). 
Around September 2024, I decided to make a concerted effort to improve.
I go once a week to powerlifting class, where we generally do the same lifts/sets/reps every time (though sometimes skip a set depending on timing and how I'm feeling that day, and sometimes the 2nd and/or 3rd heavy set may only be one or two reps, depending on if I'm pushing my weights).
It's been really gratifying to see my improvement.

I have had a couple of PT sessions to figure out my one-rep max on each of the lifts,
so I can calibrate what I attempt in the class (hence the jump in Nov 2024).

Here are my one-rep maxes (when I specifically set out to measure them), latest in bold:

| date       | lift       | weight (kg) | % bodyweight |
|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **2025-05-23** | **squat**      | **70**          | **117**          |
| **2025-05-23** | **benchpress** | **42.5**     | **70**           |
| **2025-25-23** | **deadlift**   | **90**          | **150**          |
| 2024-11-14 | squat      | 67.5        | 113          |
| 2024-11-14 | benchpress | 37.5        | 63           |
| 2024-12-11 | deadlift   | 90          | 150          |

The 2025-05-23 one-rep max session was a disappointment. 
I thought I'd be able to lift heavier, but wasn't having a good day.

My short/medium-term goals:

- squat: 80kg
- benchpress: 50kg
- deadlift: 100kg

My long-term/lifetime goals:

- squat: 90kg
- benchpress: 60kg
- deadlift: 120kg
